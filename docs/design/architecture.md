# SafeSide Architecture

The SafeSide project utilizes a microservices architecture with the following components:
- **Controller**: Manages HTTP requests.
- **gRPC Service**: Handles real-time data transfer.
- **Model**: Represents data structures.
- **Service**: Contains business logic.
- **Util**: Utility functions for processing beacon signals.

The application uses Spring Boot for the backend and gRPC for communication.
